## Top 25 Algorithms

My personal implementations of the `Top 25 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know` mentioned [here](https://www.techiedelight.com/top-25-algorithms-every-programmer-should-know/)

My two favourites are [HuffmanCodingCompression.java](https://github.com/gregdott/algorithms/blob/main/25%20Algos/src/HuffmanCodingCompression.java) and [HeapSort.java](https://github.com/gregdott/algorithms/blob/main/25%20Algos/src/HeapSort.java). I found them to be the most enjoyable of these algorithms to figure out. I also enjoyed [CountingSort.java](https://github.com/gregdott/algorithms/blob/main/25%20Algos/src/CountingSort.java) once I figured out how it actually works. On the surface it can seem a bit weird and confusing, but if you step through each part of the algorithm and look at what is actually happening it is actually a really cool way to sort a list. The most confusing and difficult to understand (easy to implement without understanding) by far (at least in my opinion) is [KMPAlgorithm.java](https://github.com/gregdott/algorithms/blob/main/25%20Algos/src/KMPAlgorithm.java).
