## Top 25 Algorithms

My personal implementations of the `Top 25 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know` mentioned [here](https://www.techiedelight.com/top-25-algorithms-every-programmer-should-know/)

Two of my favourites are [HuffmanCodingCompression.java](https://github.com/gregdott/algorithms/blob/main/25%20Algos/src/HuffmanCodingCompression.java) and [HeapSort.java](https://github.com/gregdott/algorithms/blob/main/25%20Algos/src/HeapSort.java). I found them to be the most engaging to figure out. Another interesting one is [CountingSort.java](https://github.com/gregdott/algorithms/blob/main/25%20Algos/src/CountingSort.java). On the surface it can seem a bit confusing, but stepping through each part of the algorithm shows its elegance quite clearly. The most confusing and difficult to understand (easy to implement without understanding) by far (at least in my opinion) is [KMPAlgorithm.java](https://github.com/gregdott/algorithms/blob/main/25%20Algos/src/KMPAlgorithm.java).
