 * Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a 
 * minimum spanning tree. (A minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every 
 * vertex, where the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree is minimized. For a disconnected graph, a minimum spanning 
 * forest is composed of a minimum spanning tree for each connected component.) It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as in each 
 * step it adds the next lowest-weight edge that will not form a cycle to the minimum spanning forest.

 * More simply (from https://www.techiedelight.com/kruskals-algorithm-for-finding-minimum-spanning-tree/)
 * A Minimum Spanning Tree is a spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. It connects all the vertices with minimal total weighting for its edges.
 * 
 * For this implementation we are assuming that the graph is connected, so we are looking for a minimum spanning tree (MST) (only 1). Not a forest.
 * At a later stage it will be good to extend this for unconnected graphs as well.

 * Basic algorithm:
 * (requires additional implementation of Union–Find stuff (3 operations: MAKE-SET, FIND-SET, UNION))
