 * In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two 
 * integers (numbers), the largest number that divides them both without a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, 
 * who first described it in his Elements (c. 300 BC). It is an example of an algorithm, a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation 
 * according to well-defined rules, and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, 
 * and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.
