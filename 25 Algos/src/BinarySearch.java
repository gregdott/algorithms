 * ======================================================================================================================================
 * In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, 
 * is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a SORTED array.
 * Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. 
 * If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, 
 * again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. 
 * If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.
 * ======================================================================================================================================
 * 
 * Makes O(log n) comparisons (by taking advantage of the fact that the array is sorted) which is better than linear complexity (O(n))
 * 
 * There are 2 implementations of this algorithm below. A recursive one and a loopy (iterative) one.
 * Correct behaviour is not guaranteed (obviously) if the array provided is not in ascending order
 * That is why we call the checkArrayOrdering() function before doing anything and admonish the user for reprehensible behaviour
 * 
 * On the basic test array used below, the recursive implementation appears to be ~3x more efficient. Why?
 * Even after a bit of clean up in the iterative version, the recursive solution still outperforms it by around 3x... Very interesting.
 * Lol, the time testing is not foolproof. Switching which one is called first around, the one that is called first takes ~3x longer.
 * So there must be some memory operations (possibly to do with the array?) that take place when the first one is called but do not
 * need to happen when the second one is called. Need a more robust way of testing execution times...
