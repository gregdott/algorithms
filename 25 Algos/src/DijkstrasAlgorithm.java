 * ===========================================================================================================================
 * Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, 
 * for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
 * 
 * The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes,
 * but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other 
 * nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
 * ===========================================================================================================================
 * 
 * This implementation will find the shortest-path tree for a given graph.
 * 
 * We need the following data structures:
 * - dist[i] which stores distances from source to vertex i. 
 * - prev[i] which stores the vertex we visited before visiting i. This is essentially our tree as we can track our way back to the source
 *   vertex by following j = prev[i], then we go to prev[j] and so on until we reach the source vertex. Path reconstruction.
 * - unvisited is a list containing vertices that have not been visited yet
 * 
 * It should be noted that it is assumed that there definitely is SOME path from arbitrary node a to arbitrary node b (the graph is connected)
 * If a disconnected graph is provided there will be some errors.
 * 
 * TODO: extend functionality to account for disconnected graphs
