 * In computer science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an 
 * improved selection sort: like selection sort, heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, 
 * and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into 
 * the sorted region. Unlike selection sort, heapsort does not waste time with a linear-time scan of the unsorted 
 * region; rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted region in a heap data structure to more quickly find the 
 * largest element in each step.
 * ================================================================================================================
 * 
 * There are several important steps in implementing this algorithm:
 * 
 * 1. Build Max Heap from the list of numbers. This guarantees that the largest element in the array is at the top of the heap.
 *    This is done by buildMaxHeap()
 * 
 * 2. Swap the top of the heap with the last element in the considered range, and shrink considered range by 1.
 * 
 * 3. Fix the heap. Having replaced the root of the heap with an element that most likely isn't the largest in the range,
 *    we need to ensure that the max heap's integrity is fixed. This is down by 'sifting down'. Once heap is fixed, max element
 *    in considered range is now at the root. Go back to step 2 and continue until considered range is 0.
 * 
 * By following the steps above, we progressively create a sorted section of the array starting at the end with the 
 * largest element and going down until we have sorted the whole range.
