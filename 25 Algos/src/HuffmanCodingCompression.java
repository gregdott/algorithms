 * ======================================================================================================================
 * In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is 
 * commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of 
 * Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 
 * 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".
 * ======================================================================================================================
 * 
 * After spending a while trying to understand how to build and use a Huffman Tree on Wikipedia and elsewhere,
 * and getting somewhat confused by a lot of text, I found a video by Tom Scott that explains pretty much all you
 * need to know in order to understand the basics of Huffman Coding and the implementation below. Here is the
 * video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8
 * 
 * Thanks Tom...
 * 
 * To be honest, Tom's video was more useful in understanding Huffman Encoding than anything else. This implementation
 * was based pretty much entirely on what I learnt from his video.
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The current implementation creates a tree as a linked list. Because it is a binary tree however, we could store it in an array.
 * Perhaps I will alter the implementation to work that way at some point...
