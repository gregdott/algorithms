 * ===========================================================================================================
 * In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering 
 * of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the 
 * ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may 
 * represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological 
 * ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in 
 * which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited.
 * 
 * Kahn's Algorithm:
 * One of these algorithms, first described by Kahn (1962), works by choosing vertices in the same order as 
 * the eventual topological sort. First, find a list of "start nodes" which have no incoming edges and insert 
 * them into a set S; at least one such node must exist in a non-empty acyclic graph.
