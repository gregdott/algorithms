 * From Wikipedia:
 * ======================================================================================================================================
 * Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
 * The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) 
 * and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, 
 * is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.
 * ======================================================================================================================================
 * 
 * There are 2 implentations provided:
 *  
 * Iterative
 * Recursive
 * 
 * The basic procedure is this:
 * From start node, go to first neighbour, then proceed to that neighbour's first neighbour
 * and so on until either we can go no further or until we reach a node already visited (graph is not necessarily acyclic)
 * Then, we go back to the previous node and explore other neighbours (if there are any) as far down as possible until traversing up
 * and doing the same. This will be done until all nodes have been visited.
 * 
 * In order to keep track of where we are in the graph (so that we can backtrack once we hit a dead end), we use an ArrayList
 * that keeps track of our current path. We also use an ArrayList that keeps track of which nodes we have visited. We need both
 * of these to traverse the graph (at least in this implementation).
