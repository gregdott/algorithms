 * From Wikipedia:
 * ================================================================================================================
 * Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the 
 * sequence at different speeds. It is also called the "tortoise and the hare algorithm", alluding to Aesop's fable 
 * of The Tortoise and the Hare.
 * The algorithm is named after Robert W. Floyd, who was credited with its invention by Donald Knuth. However, 
 * the algorithm does not appear in Floyd's published work, and this may be a misattribution: Floyd describes 
 * algorithms for listing all simple cycles in a directed graph in a 1967 paper, but this paper does not 
 * describe the cycle-finding problem in functional graphs that is the subject of this article. In fact, 
 * Knuth's statement (in 1969), attributing it to Floyd, without citation, is the first known appearance in 
 * print, and it thus may be a folk theorem, not attributable to a single individual.
