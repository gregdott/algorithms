 * UFNode is a class representing a node for use in Union-Find applications (disjoint data set)
 * It contains a node index and a parent index
 * It could contain a size or a rank, but for the implementation it is currently being used for (Kruskal's Algorithm), 
 * we are not going to be worrying about that.
