 * =============================================================================================================================
 * In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, is a data 
 * structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into 
 * disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding 
 * a representative member of a set. The last operation makes it possible to find out efficiently if any two elements are in 
 * the same or different sets.
 * =============================================================================================================================
 * 
 * This was implemented as part of implementing Kruskals Algorithm, so the implementation is particular to a weighted graph.

    // minimum spanning tree. It does not matter where the root is, so we just use the first node's root

     * union - This union assumes that we have already checked that the 2 nodes in the edge given do not share the same root

     * In the current implementation, we don't worry about the order in which we merge things together,
     * as the end result will be identical regardless (at least in terms of the total weight of the MST). Depending on edge weights provided,
     * we could have 2 or more different MST's for the same graph though interestingly. 
     * This will have an impact on performance for much larger graphs if we have to traverse very deep trees.
     * I imagine we could have the task of finding the deepest MST or the shallowest MST (most sensible and efficient) for a graph. In these cases it would be necessary
     * to store size/rank on UFNodes. This has not been done in this case, so efficiency has not been fully optimised.
